<blockquote>
<p>Software is eating the world. — Marc Andreeessen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You’ve probably heard this phrase, whether you read the original article in the Wall Street Journal back in 2011, or you’ve heard it echoed by CEOs, senior vice presidents, or a senior manager.</p>
<p>But it’s not just that. Not only has EVERY COMPANY had to pivot toward become a software-oriented company. Everyone is having to evolve toward a certain TYPE of software company.</p>
<p>You see there are several <strong>key factors</strong> which every software company is feeling the pressure to adopt which we’ll cover in this article.</p>
<h3 id="1continuous-delivery-pipelines">1 — Continuous delivery pipelines</h3>
<p><img  width="800" height="533" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/_astro/1_YR_8yBKB506IwOxF_YAUig.CT-ZWWdG_Z21D9yp.webp" >If there’s anything that has evolved over the past 25 years, it’s our ability to move from building our software every three months or twice a year toward a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline.</p>
<p>Shops are picking up and running the ability to have every single commit, when pushed to their source code repository, build the whole app.</p>
<p>Whether you’re using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI, Concourse, or whatever, people want to know if their latest change broke anything.</p>
<p>Maybe if you’re building an app for a Uni program or some 12-week training program you aren’t doing it. But the shop you join after that PROBABLY is. I’ve <a href="/articles/medium/2022-08-25_what-no-university-will-teach-but-is-vital-to-your-career--7b78802e72c1">mentioned this before</a>.</p>
<p>A handy talent to build up is your ability to construct and manage pipelines.</p>
<p>I happen to be the “guru” for the Spring Data team’s CI operations and manage the pipelines we use for tracking all supported branches of our 17-module system. And if you were to visit Netflix engineering, you’d discover they have an even bigger undertaking as they use Spinnaker to manage the bulk of their online services.</p>
<p><strong>Continuous integration</strong> is what lets you know that your latest patch or feature hasn’t broken the main line system.</p>
<p>And this is vital.</p>
<p>Research over the decades has revealed that the faster we can discover a bug and fix it, the lower our development costs will be. So it makes sense to let software…build our software, right?</p>
<p>On top of that, MANY shops are adopting a <strong>continuous delivery</strong> approach.</p>
<p>Continuous delivery is where go one step further than continuous integration and actually RELEASE your newly minted artifacts. This is usually a snapshot, so the people picking this up aren’t USUALLY the people running the most risk averse systems.</p>
<p>But look at shops like Netflix where they will upgrade their own systems to pick up tweaks and fixes. They even have rolling upgrades so perhaps 10% of the active nodes migrate to the fix, run it for a few hours, see if everything is good, and then let the rest of the nodes upgrade.</p>
<p>That is the extreme and probably NOT what most shops are doing.</p>
<p>But the ability to push out snapshots to maven central or artifactory, publish snapshot containers to Docker Hub automatically, and continuously push updates and bug fixes to tentative customers is slowly but surely becoming the norm and NOT the exception.</p>
<p>Don’t fight it…EMBRACE IT!</p>
<p>However, you can’t do ANY of this if you don’t do the next thing on the list.</p>
<h3 id="2secure-pipelines">2 — Secure pipelines</h3>
<p><img  width="800" height="533" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/_astro/1_FFoIZSDrSHShPfeCa_E8MQ.B4coLJt3_Z2qhI4h.webp" >Secure pipelines are about controlling all the moving parts in your software release cycle and NOT about your continuous integration pipelines.</p>
<p>If your shop does NOT control every point between your source code repository all the way to your distribution location like Docker Hub, then you could be vulnerable to attack.</p>
<p>Maybe you remember the days of Leftpad, a developer that decided to unpublish an 11-line library from npm. A library that apparently was used by LOTS of other small libraries, that ultimately through a chain of tools, was used by some of the biggest JavaScript toolkits out there including ReactJS.</p>
<p>Secure pipelines isn’t just about managing 3rd party dependencies. It begins to cover the issue of what-happens-if-our-release-engineer-gets-run-over-by-a-bus scenario. If losing one person can take down your system, you’re vulnerable.</p>
<p>It also extends into the realm of what-if-your-release-machine-were-compromised scenarios.</p>
<p>The idea is to have controlled machines able to handle your entire release process instead of user-maintained ones. Yes, it’s nice to Do It All Yourself™, but this also makes your personal machine a tasty asset to hackers. Whereas if you can delegate that task to your CI server and entrust security engineering and the sys admins to properly harden and protect your system assets, the risk shrinks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Risk is NEVER 0. There will ALWAYS be risk. But we shouldn’t be foolhardy and take reasonable measures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If your organization is trying to embrace security pipelines with controlled access to source code, CI servers, and release credentials for Docker Hub, maven central, etc., then don’t fight it. You are swimming upstream.</p>
<p>And I’m not saying to go along for no good reason.</p>
<p>Develop software locally on your work machine. But let properly protected and secured servers handle the infrastructure of it all. In the end, automated tooling will pay off and result in less weekend fires you have to put out. And you’ll sleep better at night.</p>
<p>Because you’ll need that to focus on the next point.</p>
<h3 id="3alwaysready">3 — Always ready</h3>
<p><img  width="800" height="1200" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/_astro/1_GtldMXt83ozu4WRwXvLDfQ.CpyCRZNI_wzKuO.webp" >Over the past twenty years, the number of around-the-clock always-on systems has grown by leaps and bounds. Having worked on a 24x7x365 Ops center at my previous job, I’m all too familiar with the challenges of keeping things Always On.</p>
<p>But we live in an international market.</p>
<p>Just because you’re asleep doesn’t mean your custom is asleep. Your systems need to be up and operational. And this means more testing, more realistic test scenarios, and more 9’s of availability. (Bonus points if you know what 9’s of availability even are. Let me know in the comments below!)</p>
<p>This is where having continuous integration is awesome.</p>
<p>This is where testing with things like Testcontainers for more realistic scenarios begins to sizzle.</p>
<p>This is where being able to delegate to tools like Spring Boot which pour tons of effort into not just coding new features but responding to bug reports and feature requests to constantly be patching and refining your tools.</p>
<p>(I’ve used other toolkits where the main team mostly focused on new features and much LESS time on patching older stuff. Maybe cuz’ it wasn’t cool?? Who knows?)</p>
<p>The days of planning a release every three months that requires the whole development team come in at 2:00 AM Sunday morning to minimize impact are GONE. (And yes, I did that once, long ago.) The chances of the systems you are helping to build ALWAYS having SOMEONE using them is here and now.</p>
<p>So treat your system with respect and don’t balk at sometimes having to fix critical issues at weird times. Instead, learn how to build better processes that let you patch stuff more effectively. And be ready to embrace the fact that There Will Be Bugs, even in your bug patches!</p>
<p>Which we can do a better job at dealing with in the next section!</p>
<h3 id="4realistic-testing">4 — Realistic testing</h3>
<p><img  width="800" height="534" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/_astro/1_usw_bKgo942M9zHfdN7z7w.BI_cq-vz_QgEhS.webp" >The last facet of software development in this decade is the need for more realistic testing.</p>
<p>Long ago, at the start of my career, it was common fare to manually test software bits. My first assignment was testing other people’s code. I’d fire things up and start clicking buttons. There was even a contracted “manual” that had our official test procedures.</p>
<p>But these test procedures were always out of date. So trying to reduce my OWN efforts…</p>
<p>…built something different. I started writing little functions that would call the production code, print out the results, and put them right next to the expect results. (This was before the days of JUnit, and it was Ada anyway.)</p>
<p>I had basically come up with “automated testing” on my own, and suddenly OTHER devs on the team spotted my cool idea and adopted it for themselves.</p>
<p>Then I had CRON jobs running at midnight to grab the last source code and exercise them, leaving me a report to inspect every morning.</p>
<p>But today ain’t like that. Today, we need the ability to spin up the EXACT same database the Op is using. We need the ability to pre-load the EXACT same data they were running. We need the ability to have the EXACT same collection of 3rd party dependencies the Op was using to replicate a bug.</p>
<p>And we can do that!</p>
<p>By taking start.spring.io and making a “reproducible example”, mixing in a little Testcontainers to replicate the database/message broker/whatever, feeding Spring Boot an initialization script, and leveraging Spring Boot’s test-oriented options, it’s easier than ever to create a more realistic scenario compared to canned data.</p>
<p>Yes, it’s okay to use stubs and mocks for unit-level testing. But Testcontainers and Docker have really opened things up for more accurate testing and our ability to code more scalable solutions.</p>
<p>The future of software is already here, and these tools are here to help us, not hinder us. What is YOUR favorite aspect of modern software development?</p>
<p>If you dig Spring Boot, then please stay tuned for my next article. But if you simply can’t wait, then check out the video below where you can find out whether or not you have the right skills to survive the current recession!</p>
