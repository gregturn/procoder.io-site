<h3 id="what-to-do-on-your-first-dayweekmonthyear-as-a-spring-developer-1">What to do on your first day/week/month/year as a Spring developer!</h3>
<p>So you’ve finally done it! You landed that dream position writing Spring Boot apps for a cool software company.</p>
<p>And then the shock of it hits you…what do you DO? Are you ready? Are you prepared? What should you be doing?</p>
<p><img  width="800" height="534" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/_astro/1_H_-psmWyX739YohlIF0Z8g.Dl8gOYzr_1zRWs.webp" >### 1 — What to do on your first day</p>
<p>It’s fair to assume that IT will onboard you access to email and whatever IM tool the team is using, be it Slack, HipChat, whatever.</p>
<p>Make a point of finding out who your immediate manager is as well as your immediate team mates. <strong>Write down their names.</strong></p>
<p>That’s right. Be it a little sticky note, your iPhone’s Notes app, whatever. Write down these people’s names. You may never read that note again, but the very act of writing down this information will help commit it to memory. And knowing who your immediate teammates are is key.</p>
<p>You may get invited to a particular room/channel pertinent to the team you’ve joined. As you see messages posted, take note of WHO has written those messages. You can probably click on the person’s avatar and ideally see a picture of them as well.</p>
<p>That is not all.</p>
<p>While you are reading a flurry of messages, <em><strong>take it easy</strong></em>. No one is expecting you to solve the world’s problems on your first day. <strong>Just try to drink it all in</strong>. Read every message. If there’s a link to a blog post with comments, go read that article. If there is a link to a fragment of code, click on it and start reading the code.</p>
<p>Absorbing code starts with reading it. If you’re lucky, it could be something you’re already semi-familiar with. But that’s not always the case.</p>
<p>Also, your new manager may have a set of actions for you to carry out including: <em>registration with various systems</em>, <em>filling out some e-forms</em>, and other <em>“paperwork”</em>. Do it. It’s time to start showing you’re a team player by carrying out your immediate assignments.</p>
<p>And above all…<strong>listen</strong>. You’ll be getting fed a firehouse of information. Don’t sweat it, and simply listen and read. (And if you’re smiling with excitement at your new position, that’s okay as well.)</p>
<h3 id="2what-to-do-on-your-firstweek">2 — What to do on your first week</h3>
<p>We talked about what to do on your <strong>first day</strong>. But what are some key things to do on your <strong>first week</strong>?</p>
<p>Have you gotten in touch with the system adminstrator and <em><strong>registered your github id</strong></em>? Sophisticated teams may have already covered this in their onboarding procedures, but not everyone is this deft. Giving them your github id will enable them to grant you access to the repositories you will be working on.</p>
<p>Here’s a biggie: have they sent you a work machine yet? If you’re working remotely from home, maybe not. Make sure the provisioning department <em><strong>has your mailing address</strong></em> so nothing on your end delays sending you a work machine. (If you don’t even know who to contact in the provisioning department, this is a great time to reach out to your manager.)</p>
<p>Assuming you DO have a work machine, have you cloned the immediate repository you are assigned to and:</p>
<ul>
<li>Started reading the code?</li>
<li>Installed the right tools to build it? (Java, Maven, Gradle, sdkman)</li>
<li>Inspected any CI tools used to build it? (Jenkinsfile, .circleci/<em>, .github/</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, the idea isn’t to start building epic features, but to instead become familiar with how to build the systems.</p>
<p>Also, carve out plenty of time to start reading the code.</p>
<p>BONUS: After the first week, you may want to start reading the backlog of tickets. Start getting familiar with the problems the users are running into. One again, this isn’t so that you’re ready to solve them. Instead, to start getting a feel for the pain points the community is hitting.</p>
<h3 id="3what-to-do-on-your-firstmonth">3 — What to do on your first month</h3>
<p>I have often seen a month as the MINIMUM amount of time for me to start getting the hang of a given project. This presumes I have been reading the code, building the artifacts (e.g., <em>./mvnw clean package</em>), and trying to nudge little things here and there.</p>
<p>I mentioned earlier to start reading the code. This should include the reference docs, which many projects include inside the source code. If not, find out where they are and start reading that as well.</p>
<p>Because one of the first things you can “do” in your first month, is to submit a pull request (PR) patching the ref docs. Fixing a typo, rewording a sentence. Anything along these lines. BONUS: Learn how to render the docs and inspect your handiwork. (You can often find this is you read the CI files.)</p>
<p>Other stuff you can be doing within the first month is spotting any sloppy code, old patterns (e.g., missing generic parameters, missing usage of the diamond operator, etc.), or unused import statements. Anything that simply “cleaning up” the code without actually changing the code.</p>
<p>And you should be learning exactly how your team handles change. Have they given you free reign to simply commit to the main branch? (Unlikely) Or do they want you to submit a pull request to GitHub and then request a review? And do they let you merge the change, or does someone else handle that?</p>
<p>Finally, something else you should be taking notes on is exactly HOW your team curates the change log. In other words, how does your team format commit messages? And how do they DO merges? Create a branch, rebase, then merge back? Cherry picking? What about multiple supported versions? Are you supposed to work against the latest and backport…or work against the oldest and merge forward?</p>
<p>If this is starting to sound overwhelming, that’s cool. Learning HOW your team does commits may be more of a Month 2 or Month 3 thing. And this doesn’t mean you are DOING the process. I’m just asking you to BECOME FAMILIAR with how they are doing it. If you have an approved change, you can also ask to do a pairing session to help you walk through the process.</p>
<h3 id="4what-to-do-on-your-6thmonth">4 — What to do on your 6th month</h3>
<p>By this stage, I hope you have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learned how your team handles changes, be they new features or bugs.</li>
<li>Become familiar with how they use CI and work with it, not against it.</li>
<li>Gotten ramped up on how tickets are managed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Six months in, and you should be making changes. You may not be building the biggest stuff (yet), or maybe you are? However, what’s more important than implementing the biggest features is learning how the rhythm of your team.</p>
<p>Learning how to bring value to the table calmly and consistently. They hired you for a reason. It wasn’t to be combative, but instead contribute to the team. While implementing Big Stuff is cool, closing out a dozen tiny tickets with small stuff is always a good idea and will earn you some well-deserved allies.</p>
<p>We all make mistakes (myself included). If you have shown your ability to knock bugs and patches, teammates are willing to work through mistakes. If you aren’t pulling your weight, mistakes can turn against you much faster.</p>
<p>Again, focus on your team’s process and strive to contribute to it every day.</p>
<h3 id="5what-to-do-on-your-firstyear">5 — What to do on your first year</h3>
<p>Your anniversary of your new position rolls around. It might surprise you when it does! This is a time to celebrate.</p>
<p>And hopefully, it’s also a time to push forward with providing even more value. And ideally, at this stage, you have built up a sense of the tools and apps you are assigned to.</p>
<p>But don’t settle for that. Because you should also have a feel for the types of requests and bugs the community has been reporting. You need to start looking to the future, and asking, “What should we add that would support the community the best?”</p>
<p>You can’t always ask people what they want. They don’t always know. This is Apple’s mantra — building visionary products. Sketch out some ideas and discuss them with your team. This is the future, not just fixing bugs but instead figuring out where the app will go!</p>
<p>Also, you should be looking at ways your apps interact with other apps you don’t work with directly. The Spring team has multiple sub-teams, each working on various parts of the portfolio. And all these sub-teams work with each other to make all the tools work together. You should be seeking to do the same.</p>
<p>And with a year under your built, don’t stop. Because you’re just getting started. Where are you in your current journey? Share it in the comments below!</p>
