<blockquote>
<p>Before we go any further, I understand that you may disagree with the term “AI”. These tools have no real “intelligence” whatsoever. You are probably right. But it doesn’t matter. This article focuses on the utility of these tools, not their metaphyiscal implications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of the evidence that AI tools are “it” is the fact that every third ad I see on YouTube is for someone’s course on how you can making five-figures of passive income today. <em>You and I both know THAT’s not going to happen.</em></p>
<h3 id="so-what-is-ai-good-for-and-what-should-we-not-be-using-itfor">So what IS AI good for? And what should we NOT be using it for?</h3>
<p>For starters, since it’s probably at least ONE of the questions in the back of your mind, let me answer the following question: <em>Greg, did you use AI to write this articles?</em></p>
<p><strong>This article (nor none of my others) was NOT written using any AI tools.</strong></p>
<p>I actually took a stand in my latest books <strong>against</strong> using AI to write any bit of prose. I even stated it outright, up front, for everyone to see, in the copyright page shown below of my first book to be published since my departure from the Spring team:</p>
<p><img  width="800" height="503" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/_astro/1_Br01J0BS4zmIfESv30Dl3Q.C3UKhBIK_Z1oud2l.webp" >Soon after I released this book, Amazon added a REQUIRED prompt to the its upload process asking “Is this content generated by AI?”</p>
<p>People ARE writing books using AI. People are COMPLAINING about AI-written books. People FEAR the market being flooded with AI junk.</p>
<p><strong>And I whole-heartedly agree that letting AI tools write your book for you is absolutely, 100%, as clear as I can say it <em>WRONG</em>.</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been writing for years. I studied ad copy. Penned hundreds of blog posts, articles, and am have started what will soon be my 10th and hopefully 11th book (yes, I have two books in flight right now).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of your most valued assets is the “voice” you develop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Heck, I’ve had to push back on edits from a past publisher when they tried to “edit out” my voice!</p>
<p>This lovable, tech-oriented, snarky prose you are reading is 100% me. AI can’t replace that.</p>
<p>But I have to let you know…authors are pretty HORRIBLE at ad copy.</p>
<p><em>But Greg, why do authors need ad copy??</em></p>
<p>Ad copy is something that once you discover and learn what it is, you can’t help but see it. EVERYWHERE. It’s the stuff that reads kind of like “<em>Grab your copy of 5 Ways To Do ___ and learn how to make money TODAY!</em>”</p>
<p>That expression has some key aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Action-based</strong>: Notice the comand to “grab”? This is a strong action.</li>
<li><strong>Active</strong>: Notice usage of “you” and “today”? This is aimed at the person reading it, and creating a sense of urgency making it very active.</li>
<li><strong>Appealing</strong>: Notice the drive to help the reader “make money”? This signals the value at taking on the offer.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re going to write, you need a <em><strong>certain</strong></em> amount of this. After all, if you’re writing an article on Medium, you definitely want to convince someone seeing it for the first time to <strong>click</strong> on it. You just don’t want TOO much. Don’t want to sound like a slippery car salesman, right?</p>
<p>But you can see how ad copy is DIFFERENT than prose, right? Hence, authors can build up their prose-writing talent, but not know how to write ad copy. Not know how to write up a 1-paragraph pitch to convince an acquisition editor to convince them to give that person a book-writing contract!</p>
<p><strong>Enter AI tools!</strong></p>
<p>AI tools are GREAT at this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Read this article and give me a 1-paragraph summary using middle school writing level ad copy that drives the person to click on the link at the bottom.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You type prompt into a tool like ChatGPT, then append your actual article, and in seconds, you have a nicely written up paragraph. It might be a tad off. Need a slight tuneup. But it’s probably better than what you would have written from scratch.</p>
<p>And this is a splendid usage of AI.</p>
<p>Were you going to hire someone to write it before the emergence of AI? Lots of authors don’t have much in resources, so probably not. You would have struggled to write it yourself, but that’s what you would have done.</p>
<p>Using AI to accomplish something you weren’t going to hire anyone else to do in the first place is probably okay.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-using-ai-atwork">What about using AI at work?</h3>
<p>As a content creator and training write in my current position, we have picked up and ran with AI tools!</p>
<p>In this context, its our team’s job to create slides, runnable exercises, write video scripts, and produce drawings. No one else. Us.</p>
<p>Remember how I mentioned hiring “someone else” up above? Yeah…that someone else in this situation…is just me.</p>
<p>We sit down, draw up the list of things we need to cover in a given course. We glean input from SMEs, field staff, and architects to curate that high-level list.</p>
<p>Then we fashion a multi-paragraph prompt where we describe the problem, explain “who” we are, explain “who” is receiving the training, explain what the output format is, and then feed it the list of material to cover. Then we sit back and watch it crank out a draft exercise.</p>
<p>With the exercise in hand, we deploy the newly minted exercise to our environment that runs it.</p>
<p>And then we test the HECK out of it!</p>
<p>Oftentimes, the prose is GREAT! And oftentimes, the code fragments are way off.</p>
<p>This is where we “do our job” and dig in to find out what the RIGHT way of doing each chunk of code (or each command).</p>
<p>There is still a LOT of work to get this challenge exercise operational. But the point is, we didn’t start from zero. No, we started at 40% with someone we can edit. We noodled through it, and were able to focus on the criticals.</p>
<p>The AI tool was able to help us knock out the prose and the structure, kind of like how an IDE can help you with formatting a Java class file including auto-generated getters and setters.</p>
<h3 id="is-that-it-using-a-tool-to-skip-over-the-beginning-phase-of-something">Is that it? Using a tool to skip over the beginning phase of something?</h3>
<p>No.</p>
<p>We go way further than that.</p>
<p>Remember me mentioning slides earlier? We take our series of exercises and feed them back into the AI tool, and ask it to generate reveal.js/asciidoctor slides. The prompt has more details in it again describing who they are for, how the work with the exercises, and how we want to have Q&#x26;A review questions after the exercises.</p>
<p>And then the AI tool will crank out a round of slides.</p>
<p>And then we can iterate on THAT.</p>
<p>It’s really amazing how far you can get with this stuff. To top things off, we’ve noticed strengths in weakness in various AI tools. And we’ve figured out how to use them together.</p>
<p>To explain how that works, there’s a riddle you may or may not have heard of.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are standing outside two doors. Behind one door is a vast trove of riches beyond your wildest dreams. Behind the other door is certain death. You can open either door. Next to the doors are two guards. They both know what is behind which door. One always tells the truth, one always lies. If you could ask one question, what would it be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is to ask one of them, “which door would the other guy suggest?” and then open the OTHER door.</p>
<p>If you are talking to the truth-teller, he will truthfully tell you that the other guy would lyingly recommend the door that offers death. So you pick the other door.</p>
<p>If you are talking to the liar, he knows that the other guardian will tell you the door with the riches behind it. But he will lie and tell you to take the door that portends your death. So you pick the other door.</p>
<p>You see, you are taking a shaky circumstance, and using BOTH of them together, to effect a positive change.</p>
<p>With AI tools, their strength is being able to process HUGE volumes of text and then give you a guided answer based on your prescription.</p>
<p>And so we will take the slide content generated by one AI tool, and carry it over to another AI tool and run it through a “finishing” process.</p>
<p>We basically have ANOTHER prompt where we instruct this finisher that its job is to “edit” the first AI tool. Don’t alter the structure. But help clean up any code blocks. Also look for glaring issues.</p>
<p>And in general, this has helped us crank out HUGE volumes of content.</p>
<p>Now remember the criteria I mentioned earlier! The only people getting displaced by this…is us! We are the team that is building this content. So any tool that helps us speed up the write-read-review-test-update process directly, is a boon!</p>
<p>What are you doing with AI?</p>
<p>Someone has to verify every spec of the content the crosses your desk. That someone…is you.</p>
<p>There is fear of these tools supplanting whole developers. That fear has some amount of justification. But there is going to be a growing number of people needed to cross-check and verify what is being generated.</p>
<p>AI isn’t destroying any industries. It’s just another tool that can accelerate some things. The idea is to learn its strengths, make certain principaled decisions about what to use it and not use it for, and then be comfortable in the places that you’re okay with doing that.</p>
<p>You’ve heard some of the ways I’m doing it (which includes generating banner images for these articles, someone I wasn’t going to pay anyone to do anyway). What about you? Have you used AI tools for anything? Put it in the comments!</p>
