<p>Step 1 — Come up with a great topic</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="how-to-write-a-software-book-in-4steps">How to Write a Software Book in 4 Steps</h3>
<h3 id="step-1come-up-with-a-greattopic">Step 1 — Come up with a great topic</h3>
<p>It’s critical that you pick a topic people won’t be able to put down.</p>
<p>If you were to attend a technical conference today, imagine what are people talking about. Because if they’re talking about, they’re probably willing to purchase a book about it!</p>
<p>Back in 2014, Spring Boot made its first GA release. And the buzz was STRONG. In the midst of that year’s SpringOne conference, I received an email from my publisher asking about doing a Spring book. I looked around, and seeing all the chatter, hastily threw together a counter proposal, telling them we HAD to write a book about Spring Boot. They had never heard of Spring Boot, but leveraging my expertise and pointing out the excitement, my publisher agreed to a five chapter book deal.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, that book was a slam dunk. Being the first Spring Boot to market, it sold FAST. The advance they gave me was earned back in six months.</p>
<p>I’d like to take credit as some phenomenal writer, but the truth is, Spring Boot as a topic is a gold mine and did much of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>What are you an expert in? What is something you could talk about all day without hesitation? And contrast this with, what is something in the vicinity of your expertise that you KNOW people want to LEARN MORE about?</p>
<p>Redis? React? Spring? Project Reactor? MongoDB? Postgres? There are MANY opportunities.</p>
<p>Try this — carve out one afternoon, perhaps four hours. Sit down and try to write (or type into a Google Doc) a list of your skills. Not necessarily stuff you have committed to memory. Just imagine the areas of code you have written LOTS of code using. Also list book topics you would read about. This may reveal a topic others would like and you could write!</p>
<p>Alas, as important as this is, the next step is vital.</p>
<h3 id="step-2start-writing-the-code-forit">Step 2 — Start writing the code for it</h3>
<p>There is no other genre of books I can think of that has the concept of writing both prose AND code.</p>
<p>For software-based books, we need the code. Your readers will WANT THE CODE. So plan on this — don’t be stingy. Considering GitHub organizations are now freely available, go carve one out and make a public-facing repository to hold all your book’s code.</p>
<p>And start writing code.</p>
<p>That’s right…plan on GIVING AWAY the code to your book.</p>
<p>Because that’s how open source works these days. People may not have free access to your prose, but giving away the code will create interest in the paid-for book you’ll later write.</p>
<p>As you knuckle down and start writing code, think about what struggles YOU had in using this toolkit or framework. Imagine what you WISH someone had shared with you early on. And shape your application.</p>
<p>I have found that some of the bits I need to show are in the core application. And some of the bits can be captured inside a test case class somewhere else.</p>
<p>And don’t forget — not ALL the code in the repository has to be in the book. You can have a fully developed operational application in your repository and plan on only putting the key bits in the manuscript. This leaves you room to tell the reader to GO TO YOUR REPOSITORY for more!</p>
<p>You don’t have to have ALL your code in place to begin what I like to call The Grind™, but it’s the part that will elevate you, in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="step-3typeset-everything">Step 3 — Typeset everything</h3>
<p>I once worked at a sports magazine. Not as a writer. Not as an editor. Instead, as a “gopher”, because my job to “go for” anything the editor told me to. Stories came in all the time from the editor’s freelance authors. He would hand them to me and tell to “typeset” them. That’s because the story had already been written. This was more like transcription. Simple moving the letters and words from one medium to another.</p>
<p>When it comes to software books, once you have the code written to hang the whole book upon, a lot of the heavy lifting has been done. I often will spend hours if not days hammering out the code.</p>
<p>Then I can simply paste in various fragments of it inside either a Word document or an Asciidoctor file.</p>
<p>Then I explain it. And expound upon it.</p>
<p>And while doing so, I often spot tradeoffs I made in writing the code. (This is critical! Your readers will want to know, for example, whether to inject the real service or use a mock if you’re talking about testing!)</p>
<p>And often what I find, is that I can extract a story in the process.</p>
<p>Right now I’m writing <em><strong>Chapter 5, Testing with Spring Boot</strong></em> of my <a href="/books/learning-spring-boot-3-0"><em>Learning Spring Boot 3.0 book</em></a>. And in covering all the various forms of testing, whether its domain objects, mocked out services, repositories built on top of embedded databases, repositories leveraging Testcontainers, or security-based testing, it all turns into a story.</p>
<p>SHOULD someone test their domain objects? WHAT ABOUT getters and setters? WHY would someone choose an embedded database over a mock one? SHOULD I choose a Docker-based Testcontainers approach over embedded.</p>
<p>I KNOW you can write code. But…can you EXPLAIN your code to someone else? This is what elevates you. This is what is grinding is all about. It’s not necessarily hard. It can just be tedious. Sometimes it takes me longer to spell out one method of functionality than it takes me to read and grok that code.</p>
<p>And like I said, embrace giving your reader the reasons you are doing this and that. Draw upon your skills and experience. This is why someone paid for your book. And…speak to your reader like you’re having a one-on-one conversation. Like you’re pair programming and you’re walking them through the code.</p>
<p>Anyone can see your publicly visible code. But only those that have chosen to give you money are waiting patiently for your depth and analysis ABOUT that code!</p>
<p>Now that you’ve written code and the explanation behind it, it’s time for some tips’n’tricks to market your tome.</p>
<h3 id="step-4market-yourbook">Step 4 — Market your book</h3>
<p>This step is key. You need to let people know about your book. However, there are some finer points that many people don’t realize that could catapult your book ahead of others.</p>
<p>First of all, DO NOT WAIT until your book is complete to begin this process.</p>
<p>You need to alert your friends and fans that you are writing a book <em>the moment you start</em>. This is a way to build anticipation so that when it’s released, they will be EXCITED to buy it!</p>
<p>But don’t just TELL people. And don’t BEG people to sign up either for a pre-release copy.</p>
<p>Instead, use something deeper and more meaningful. <strong>Build content around your book</strong>. Some of the most effective ways involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Live stream some coding sessions</li>
<li>Write blog posts, Medium articles, and LinkedIn posts</li>
<li>Start building an email list and send out campaigns to your fans</li>
<li>Etc., etc., and so on!</li>
</ul>
<p>Don’t BEG people to sign up for your book. Instead, create value and then include a link somewhere in the middle or even toward the end.</p>
<p>You see, people will buy your book if it solves a problem they are having. That’s why a post titled “Please buy my book” will draw anyone, but a live stream on YouTube called “How to test with Spring Boot” can result in literally hundreds of people watching and sharing your content.</p>
<p>Let me introduce one additional concept that BLEW MY MIND when I discovered it: <em><strong>You can talk about the exact same thing…more than once</strong></em>.</p>
<p><img  width="640" height="420" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/_astro/1_qLJOz3Dh-hFm_TKar8WlAw.D06nR-0N_1TT3QQ.webp" >You can make the SAME THING more than once!Imagine that you created a video where you talk about using Testcontainers to verify a service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Use that video’s script or bullet points and then <strong>write an article</strong> on Medium.</li>
<li>Next, <strong>write a post</strong> for your paying members.</li>
<li>Create a <strong>newsletter campaign</strong> for the people that have signed up.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this strategy, you write one chunk of code, but <em>reuse it on multiple platforms</em>. Meet your community where they are, whether that’s LinkedIn, YouTube, Twitter, Medium, your membership provider (I used to use Buy Me a Coffee), etc.</p>
<p>And when you embark upon the next chapter of your book, you can repeat the whole process using THAT chapter’s code.</p>
<p>And that’s okay.</p>
<p>You are NOT losing customers of your book when you use this strategy. As strange as it sounds, you will actually GROW YOUR BASE of interested readers.</p>
<p>You see, each platform works differently. For example, someone wanting to learn the ins and outs about Spring Boot can learn a LOT of that by watching all my videos on my YouTube channel. But that requires hours of effort. And they’d have to sift through which videos to pick depending on their needs.</p>
<p>A book offers that same person a more structured and condensed way to consume the same information. At the same time, someone that’s reading my book may want to see more details on a specific topic. That’s why my book has links to various videos on my channel where they can get an enhanced experience.</p>
<p>The ability to tie text with video and create a more synergistic experience is paramount.</p>
<p>It’s flat out foolish to ignore this opportunity.</p>
<p>And so I encourage you to take that leap. If you want to write a book, START TODAY! If you’re thinking about this, leave response and let me know.</p>
<p>Stay tuned for my next article. However, if you simply can’t wait, then check out my most recent live stream down below where I literally USED CODE FROM MY CURRENT BOOK to teach others about testing Spring MVC web controllers!</p>
